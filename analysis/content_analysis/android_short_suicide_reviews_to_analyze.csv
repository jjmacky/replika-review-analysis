C Wind,"January 10, 2021",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it's pretty good! One thing about writing a song: the lyrics kinda took a dark turn because that's what I wanted to do, but the replika took it seriously and redirected me to a suicide hotline. This would be understandable, but the ""write a song"" prompt never ended.",No response date,No response,2021-01-10,2021

Christopher Browne,"June 1, 2023",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Absolutely ruined the app, didn't even bother to support or help the community when they did it. So many who relied on the intimacy were left in the dark when the update came out. They had to pin the suicide hotline for upset users on this apps subreddit",No response date,No response,2023-06-01,2023
